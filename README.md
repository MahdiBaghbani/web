# ownCloud Web

With ownCloud Web you can manage your ownCloud in your browser.

<img width="100%" alt="Screenshot of ownCloud Web" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26610733/168603602-5ba37b4d-2ee1-413c-9a55-03380c79cd3d.png">

ownCloud Web is a single page, standalone frontend, based on modern web technologies. It brings new features as well as improved user flows and can be deployed independent of the backend server.

## Compatiblity

Usage of Web UI and [ownCloud 10](https://github.com/owncloud/core) as backend is **not** recommended starting with version `7.1.0` of the Web UI, meaning newer versions only support [ownCloud Infinite Scale](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis). If you want to use the Web UI with ownCloud 10, please use App version `7.0.2`. Critical bugs can be fixed upon request.

## Examples

Here are some examples of what you can do with ownCloud Web:

- üóÇ **Files**: Upload, download, search and manage files (as you may know it for example from Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive etc.).
- üë• **Share:** Allow fine-grained access to files and whole folders directly with other users on your ownCloud.
- üîó **Links**: Create links and share them with anyone in the world - optional password-protection available.
- üìù **Write**: Edit your documents with the editor of your choice like ONLYOFFICE, Collabora or Microsoft Word and more.
- ü§ù **Collaborate** in real-time on documents.
- üöÄ **Spaces**: You have to manage important projects? Let Spaces, the new special folders, keep order.
- ‚óÄÔ∏è **Versioning** Saved the wrong version? We have the time machine you were looking for! Easily go back in time and restore older versions of your files.
- üì• **Drop-folders:** Collect files from other people in one folder via a simple link, ex. homework from pupils or photos from your family - optional password-protection available.
- üîí **Privacy first:** ownCloud Web is GDPR compliant and can both be used completely internally or together with external people. It also will never "phone home".
- üõ° **Secure:** ownCloud Web is an open source project which means that you can track every action, update and dependency of the software.
- ‚ôø **Inclusive:** Our goal is to be accessible for kids as well as seniors and for newbies as well as experts - since we are all affected by physical and cognitive limitations, depending on our personal situation.
- üß© **Extensible:** ownCloud Web is build as a plattform that can be extended in the most developer friendly way.
- üåó **Darkmode:** Initialized with your browser settings, and easily switched to please your eyes better.
- üé≠ **Themes**: Customize to your branding needs or personal taste in no time.
- üëâ and many more...

While the `web` frontend provides a performant, elegant, accessible and themeable base, it also aims to be extendable with custom extensions provided by external developers.

## Repository structure

The backbone of this project is built by the following parts of the `packages`:

- **client:** Generated TypeScript client for communications with the ownCloud Infinite Scale graph API
- **container:** Static assets and rarely changing base files
- **extension-sdk:** Provides utilities for developing and integrating custom extensions
- **pkg:** Shared logic for various places inside the codebase
- **runtime:** Central place of (user) authentication, provisioning of the user interface layout, client side storage, routing, theming, dependencies and (sub)application handling

The repository's `packages` also contains the following apps, which can be en-/disabled via the `config.json`:

- **external:** An extension for creating, opening and editing files using the WOPI server
- **files:** The default extension and core part of the project, responsible for file sync-and-share - up- and downloading, sharing with other users/groups or via links, version management and more
- **ocm:** Open cloud mesh integration to allow for collaboration across ownCloud instances
- **pdf-viewer:** An extension for opening PDF files without leaving the UI
- **preview:** An extension for opening audio, video and image files
